This repository contains the full implementation developed for the Harvard University Data Science Capstone project **Data-Driven Modelling of Solar PV Inverters**.  
The project builds a comprehensive analytical and modeling framework for monitoring, evaluating, and predicting the performance of solar photovoltaic (PV) inverters using real-world SCADA data.

The work integrates **five major components**:

---

## 🔹 1. Digital Twin (DT) Modeling
A data-driven hybrid Digital Twin capable of reconstructing and estimating inverter performance under varying environmental and operational conditions.

Includes:
- Physics-informed efficiency modeling  
- ML-based residual modeling  
- Feature engineering (POA, DC/AC metrics, thermal conditions, etc.)  
- Standardized, gap-filled, and cleaned data streams for downstream tasks  

---

## 🔹 2. Predictive Maintenance (PM)
A machine-learning pipeline designed to signal emerging inverter degradation and abnormal behaviour.

Key features:
- Ensemble models (XGBoost, Random Forest)  
- Density-based clustering (DBSCAN) for failure mode identification  
- Early-risk detection through engineered future-failure labels  

---

## 🔹 3. Survival Analysis
Statistical reliability modeling using:
- Kaplan–Meier estimators  
- Cox Proportional Hazards  
- Time-to-event analysis for inverter health under partially labeled conditions  

---

## 🔹 4. Time-Series Forecasting
Short-term and day-ahead power forecasting using:
- LSTM architectures  
- SARIMA  
- VAR with exogenous variables  
- Trend-decomposition approaches from the literature  

These methods support early-warning alerts for underperformance.

---

## 🔹 5. Anomaly Detection
A multi-signal anomaly detection framework combining:
- Digital Twin reconstruction errors  
- Power-curve deviation  
- Operational rule-based thresholds  

This system highlights potential issues such as sensor faults, panel soiling, environmental disruptions, or inverter misbehavior.
